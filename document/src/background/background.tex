Some underlying principles of the theoretical topics on which the  for this thesis are presented in this chapter.
All the topics of this chapter are present in the proposed model but some of the material is presented in greater detail that is completely necessary for understanding the model.

Firstly this chapter begins on the principles and handling of spatio-temporal data with emphasis on modelling it with advection fields.
Subsequently, an introduction to the neural network basics is presented.
Then the concepts of Bayesian filtering are presented and the Kalman filter defined with challenges and remedies related to the filtering of high-dimensional data. 

By reviewing these concepts, this chapter aims to give a foundation to understand the proposed model's underlying mechanisms presented in subsequent chapters
