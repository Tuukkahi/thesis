\Subject { Physics-informed neural networks have proved themselves as valuable supplements to classical mathematical models. Compared to regular physics-free neural networks, boundary conditions can be better enforced in the physics-informed variants. The computational efficiency of neural networks makes them feasible for many applications not possible with classical methods. Most real-world observations and mathematical models are subject to uncertainties. The Kalman filter is a solution to the uncertainty quantification to problems of uncertain observations and models. The ensemble Kalman filter provides an efficient Monte Carlo approximation when dealing with large data vectors. In this thesis, a neural network is constructed to infer velocity fields within the advection equation. The model is trained with meteorological cloud data. Despite the intrinsic difficulties with the training data, the neural network model is shown to learn the dynamics of the advection equation even with simpler synthetic data. In addition, the neural network presents comparable results with a commonly used method for optical flow estimation. The network is used as a state process operator in the ensemble Kalman filter. A simulated setting of partial observations with an attempt to produce complete state ensembles is tested. The network functions expectedly within the Kalman filter model. }
