In this section, the hybrid model incorporating neural networks with the statistical state-space modelling techniques is elaborated.
The developed model is compromised of two main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        A neural network based model that learns the patterns and dynamics of advection fields from spatio-temporal data.
    \item
        A Kalman filter that leverages the neural network as a state model in the state-space model to provide probabilstic state estimates.
\end{itemize}

The objective is to generate realistic deterministic state-estimates using the neural network and then utilise the Kalman filter model to assimilate observation data to improve the estimates and generate probability distributions states.

The advection field estimation model is similar to the one laid out in~\cite{debezenac}, and application of the model in the Bayesian filtering setting draws inspiration from~\cite{deepide}.
However, both of these models are trained for sea surface temperature data which is substantially different from the data considered in this thesis.
